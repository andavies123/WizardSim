- **Control Nodes**:
	- Internal nodes that define how to traverse the behavior tree
	- These nodes will always contain at least one child whether it is another control node or an execution node
	- Sequence (â†’):
		- Execute children in order until one child returns a "Failure" or all children return a "Success"
	- Fallback (?):
		- Execute children in order until one of them returns a "Success" or all children return a "Failure"
		- These nodes are key in designing recovery behaviors for your autonomous agents
		- Opposite of Sequence
	- Parallel (->->):
		- Executes all children in "parallel"
		- Returns a "Success" when 1 to n children return a "Success"
		- Returns a "Failure" when all children return a "Failure"
	- Decorator (&):
		- Typically only have one child, and modifies its behavior with some custom defined policy
		- Common policies:
			- Invert
			- Repeat/Retry
			- Timeout
			- Force Failure
			- Success Is Failure
		- Should use decorators sparingly as they can add unnecessary complexity
- **Execution Nodes**:
	- Usually the leaves of the tree, these should not have any children elements
	- Condition:
		- Returns a "Success" or "Failure" within a single tick
		- Generally represent simple checks (e.g., "Is door open?")
	- Action:
		- Can span over multiple ticks by returning "Running"
		- Generally represent complex Actions (e.g., "Open the door")
	- Order of Action/Conditions do matter. For example if the condition is first and returns a "Failure" the action will not be ran.
