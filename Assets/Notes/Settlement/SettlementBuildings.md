# Settlement Buildings

There will be many buildings that the player will be able to place around the settlement. Here are a few that I am thinking about in the moment:

### Settlement Hall
- The center of the settlement
- There should only be one of these buildings per settlement
- When this building is selected, the player should be able to change some attributes of the settlement such as:
  - Settlement name
  - Move its position
  - Open some menus such as the task management window
  - See quick stats for the settlement
