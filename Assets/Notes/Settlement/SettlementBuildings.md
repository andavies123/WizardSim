# Settlement Buildings

There will be many buildings that the player will be able to place around the settlement. Here are a few that I am thinking about in the moment:

### Settlement Hall
- The center of the settlement
- There should only be one of these buildings per settlement
- When this building is selected, the player should be able to change some attributes of the settlement such as:
  - Settlement name
  - Move its position
  - Open some menus such as the task management window
  - See quick stats for the settlement

### Sleeping Quarters
- Where the wizards will go to sleep for the night
- There does not necessarily need to be enough beds for all the wizards, but if a wizard does not sleep, they will not have full stats
- Some wizards would sleep at different times, such as ones that are standing guard in the night time

### Hospitals
- There will be a wizard who is specialized in medical spells that will man this building.
- Research will help make medicine spells faster and better.
- Wizards who are injured or sick will come here to be healed.
- There can be multiple hospital buildings per settlement

### Farms
- There will have to be farms in the settlement in order to produce food as a resource for the rest.
- Earth wizards will most likely be in charge of these as they are well... earth wizards.
- There will be multiple types of farms or at least each farm will be able to grow different types of food.

### Food Storages
- There will be buildings specifically for storing food.
- Each storage will have a max amount of food it can hold, so the player will have to build more storages or upgrade them to hold more as the settlement grows.
- These buildings will be able to hold all types of food, don't want to make it too annoying to have a different storage per food type.

### Water Storages
- Wizards will need water to live, so we will have to collect water and store it in a storage tank.
- Water wizards will be in charge of collecting water and putting it in the tank.
- I'm imagining a wizard coming from a stream/lake with a floating ball of water in front of them. No bucket, just the ball of water.

### Research Building
- At the beginning of the settlement, the wizards won't know too much or won't be that powerful.
- The research building will be in charge of learning new abilities, or learning upgrades for new buildings and so forth.
- I haven't decided if I would want multiple of these buildings per settlement and have the research go faster with each building? Or have one building and be able to assign more and more wizards to it.

### Kitchens
- These buildings will be in charge of transforming the food that came from the farms into food that can be more "nutritious" and count as more food resources.
- The higher the level of the wizard that is assigned there, the better types of food that will be produced.
- These buildings won't be necessary as the player can just use the food directly from the farm.

### Workshops
- These buildings will be in charge of creating/upgrading wizard tools such as wands or gear.
- The higher the level of the wizard that works here, the better the gear can be upgraded/made.
- These buildings aren't necessary, but can help improve the settlement

### Defense Pillars
- These buildings will be stationary towers that wizards can sit in to have a better range when defending the settlement against incoming waves of enemies.
- These buildings will also provide extra defense to the wizards that are using them, and could act as a distraction to give the settlement some extra time when defending.

### Defensive Structures
- These buildings will act as non-automated defense buildings (like a turret) that wizards can mount to get working.
- These buildings wouldn't be able to run on their own and would need a wizard in order to be used.
- One idea would be like a turret that could shoot larger fireballs when a fire wizard mounted it, or lightning bolts when a lightning wizard mounts it.
- There would be multiple types of structures under this category that would need to be worked through, and these can be upgraded eventually to become stronger and even possibly have 2 wizards mount them.
