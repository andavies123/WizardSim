# Wizard Aging

A wizard will behave differently depending on their age. Certain jobs will be available or will have different priorities depending on the age. Aging with wizards will have multiple stages:

### Child (0 - 9)
- Children will not be able to put in any work around the settlement.
- Children will take up resources, although the resources that are taken up should be less then usual (since they're smaller).

### Teen (10 - 19)
- Teens will be able to put in some work around the settlement, although the amount of work is much less.
- Teens will take up a regular amount of resources (since they're growing).
- Teens will not be able to reproduce

### Adult (20 - 999)
- Adults will put in the most work around the settlement.
- Adults will take up a regular amount of resources.
- Adults should live a long time (Game wouldn't be fun if everyone kept dying).
- Adults should be able to reproduce to have more wizards around the settlement.

### Elderly (999 - Death)
- The elderly will put in less work than teens since they're aging and could die.
- The elderly will take up the same amount of resources and children.
- The elderly will not be able to reproduce
- How long the elderly will live once they reach this age will depend on the settlement's research on health care
