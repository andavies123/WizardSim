# Enemy Types

The game will include multiple types of enemies spanning over multiple difficulty types.

These enemies should have both a counter and a vulnerability to different wizard types so the player doesn't try and use one single wizard type when growing their settlement.

Each of these enemies could have different variants for each of the different wizard types so that they will have those strengths / weaknesses against the different wizard types.

### Slime

A slime can be considered as one of the most basic enemies in the game. It shouldn't take that much damage to take them down. They won't have a lot of attack power and won't attack at a range (for now).
