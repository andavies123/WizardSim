int MaxHealth:
    The max amount of health the object can have. The health value will not go over this value
    
bool CanRechargeHealth:
    When this value is true, the object will recharge health a certain amount of time after taking damage.
    If this value is false, then the following properties don't have to be set: HealthGainedPerInterval, RechargeIntervalMSec, TimeUntilRechargeStartsMSec.
    Value is defaulted to false if not added.
    
int RechargeIntervalMSec:
    While recharging health, this is how often in milliseconds the object will "recharge" some health.
    This value could be used to slow down the recharge to make it longer to get back to full health.
    
float HealthGainedPerInterval:
    This value describes how much health will be gained during each recharge interval.
    Currently, there is no check to make sure this number is > 0 
    
int TimeUntilRechargeStartsMSec:
    This value describes how long it takes in milliseconds to start recharging health after the object takes damage
